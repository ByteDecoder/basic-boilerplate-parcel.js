# basic-boilerplate-parcel.js
Basic Front-End boilerplate setup with Parcel

This package is going to accelerate your experiments by adding dependencies to your **package.json** with some js libraries and creating a basic folder structure to start
working with **Parcel**. Also helps you with *SASS* and **PostCSS**

Run

```bash
$ node node basicBoilerplateSetup.js 
```

Then you can use the **package.json.new** with all the dependencies replacing your original package file. Then execute:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```
